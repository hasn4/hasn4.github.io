                    Pause is an Alarm clock and a Mediations app which which allows users to pick from sounds of nature as alarm tone of to be played in the background while they meditate or trying to relax.<br>
                    Research has shown hash alarm tones can increase individuals blood pressure and can leave you feeling groggy.<br>
                    Pause helps users stay on track while not adding to their existing stress level and the Sound section let’s users pick from library of sounds to be played for set amount of time (which they set)  while they meditate or are trying to relax or if they want play something in background while they study or work, it really depends on users how and when they want to use the app.

                    To make an app which allows users to set alarm and pick from the library of natural sounds to be used as wake up tune.  The app should give user information if alarm is set and time till alarm goes off.<br>
                    The app should allow user to play from the same library of sounds, background music while they meditate or are trying to relax. The user should be able to set length to time the background music is played for and stop after.

                    To kick start my research I sent an email arounds my office (about 120 individuals) inviting them to take part and picked 5 out of those who replied.<br>
                    When picking I choose individuals belong to different age groups, this helped when designing to keep users from different  age group in mind. Interviews were conducted via Microsoft teams.<br>
                    Findings from this helped me create a survey for wider audience which allowed me to test some hypothesis and identify user patterns.

        <p>Using Crazy-8 technique I made some quite sketches on Pro-create. This helped in quickly visualise my thoughts and refine them into something i can work towards.<br>
            After getting my quick sketches cleaned up I moved to Figma where I made user flow, wireframes, low-fidelity and finally high-fidelity prototypes.<br>
            During this time I used Mobbin see other apps in the market for inspiration.

  <p>Testing something which shouldn’t be taken lightly.<br>
     To make sure my prototype functions as intended for the wider audience testing, I ran several tests myself and invited users from my research interviews to test run the app in a live session via Microsoft teams.<br>    
     During these tests I tried different colours palette, visual images, icons and fonts.

    <p>Possibly the most exciting part. Using Lookback I sent my high-fidelity prototype to video audience to trial. After the initial three tests I reviewed their feedback and watched their progress. This helped me identify some improvement opportunities for accessibility and overall design. I then repeated the same process with next three and four after.<br>
        This than lead me to my final designs.<br>
        In the end I exported the designs to Zeplin to create a style guide for engineering handoff.

<p><b>Keep things simple!</b><br>
    What works for you might not work for everyone. We often when designing forget to to understand our users will probably not know as much about the product as we (the designer know) so keeping things simple and and finding a good balance between overcrowded screens and lacking screens is key.
